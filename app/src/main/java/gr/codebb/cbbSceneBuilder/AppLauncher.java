/**
 * Launcher Class Upon closer inspection you will notice that the scripts are not creating packages
 * and executables for App (which extends the standard JavaFX Application class) but for
 * AppLauncher. When an Application class gets launched then JavaFX will check whether the JavaFX
 * modules are present on the module path. But since we are placing them on the classpath the
 * application can not launch. As a work-around we are starting a standard Java class with a main
 * method in it. This prevents the module path check and the application will launch just fine.
